# AI4FINANCIALGOOD

## Prompt  

The introduction of publicly available AI tools like ChatGPT, Siri, and Grammarly in the past several years has revolutionized the way we work, learn, and communicate. With so many rapid changes, it can be hard to know how to approach topics or areas AI has impacted. For this Challenge, we want you to focus on how AI might be used to empower people in a very concrete way that affects all of us – money. Imagine a tool that uses AI to help people make better decisions with their money. What would it do? Who would it help? What data would it use? How could it address some of the financial inequalities that currently exist in the world? In this Challenge, we want you to dream big! We want to be clear - you do not have to create an AI tool. Rather, we want you to think about the design and decisions that would go into making this tool. Your final product should:  
➔ Support people with their financial needs, whether that be budgeting, saving
money, debt, taxes, or anything else!  
➔ Aim to address issues of inequality that currently exist  
➔ Incorporate the use of AI as a key element of your solution
