# Fy: Your Financial Guide!

Girls Who Code at OCC: AI4FinancialGood Challenge Project.

## Description

This terminal based AI assistant will track user data. It will then make informative suggestions based on what the user requests.

- Customizability (WIP):
      * The user will be asked a series of questions when creating their profile for the first time. These questions will guide the AI in the direction that the             user wants to give the user a completely customized financial assistant.
              Possible Options:
                    - Spend less money

- Possible Questions (WIP):
      * How much does the average consumer spend on [xyz]?
      * Where am I spending too much money?
